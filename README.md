## What is the problem
When the power goes out it can be hard to distinguish the cause of the issue *especally in the more rural parts of San Antonio*.
With out working wifi the only way to trouble shoot is to reset your fuse box then call CPS energy to report an outage. Once you call in the only way to verify it was reported is to navigate to this <a href="http://outagemap.cpsenergy.com/CPSStaticMapsEXT/CPSStaticMapV2_EXT.html">CPS outagemap</a> on mobile.
